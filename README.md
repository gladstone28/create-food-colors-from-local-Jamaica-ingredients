That’s a wonderful and sustainable initiative! Creating natural food colorants from local Jamaican ingredients is very feasible and aligns with the growing demand for clean-label, plant-based products.

Here’s a step-by-step guide you can use to assist your friend:

✅ 1. Identify Common Natural Sources by Color
🌿 Red / Pink:
Sorrel (Hibiscus sabdariffa)

Beetroot

Roselle flowers

🌿 Yellow / Orange:
Turmeric root

Annatto seeds (from Achiote tree)

Pumpkin or carrot

Marigold petals (calendula)

🌿 Green:
Callaloo (Amaranth)

Moringa leaves

Spinach

🌿 Blue / Purple:
Blue Pea Flower (Butterfly Pea) – Clitoria ternatea

Red cabbage (can shift to blue or purple depending on pH)

🌿 Brown:
Coffee

Cocoa

Burnt sugar (Caramel)

✅ 2. Extraction Methods
Choose the right method based on the ingredient:

✳️ Water-Based Extraction:
Good for most leaves, flowers, and fruits. Steps:

Chop fresh or dried material.

Simmer in a small amount of water for 10–20 minutes.

Strain and cool.

Store in sterilized containers.

✳️ Alcohol-Based (Ethanol or Rum):
Used for longer shelf life or to pull out color from tough ingredients (like annatto).

Soak the ingredient in food-safe alcohol.

Let sit for several hours or overnight.

Strain.

✳️ Oil-Based:
For fat-soluble colors (e.g., turmeric).

Gently heat the ingredient in coconut or vegetable oil.

Filter and bottle.

✅ 3. pH Sensitivity (Very Important)
Some colors shift depending on acidity:

Red cabbage: Purple in neutral, red in acid, green/blue in base.

Butterfly pea: Blue in neutral, purple/pink in acidic.

Your friend may want to test their extract in various pH environments (e.g., vinegar, lemon juice, baking soda).

✅ 4. Preservation Tips
Refrigerate extracts and use within 1–2 weeks (unless alcohol-based).

Use citric acid or vinegar as natural preservatives.

Store in sterilized, dark glass bottles to prevent light degradation.

✅ 5. Applications
Test in:

Icing/frosting

Drinks

Rice or dumplings

Homemade candies

Yogurts

✅ 6. Legal & Food Safety
If selling:

Ensure ingredients are food-grade.

Label clearly (“Natural Food Color - Turmeric”).

Follow Jamaican Ministry of Health regulations.

✅ 7. Branding & Business Tips
Focus on local pride and eco-friendly branding.

Offer small glass dropper bottles.

Use social media to show demo videos (e.g., making pink lemonade with sorrel extract).
